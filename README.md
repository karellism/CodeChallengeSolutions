# Code Challenge Solutions
## Found at [GitHub](https://github.com/karellism/CodeChallengesSolutions)

This repository consists of code solutions to problems and challenges on different sites.
And also I am aiming to have as much solutions as possible in a few programming languages.
At this moment Java will be the most occuring solution language, followed by C++.
I would like to have at least a Java, C and C++ solution for every problem in the end.
An end that will probably never come, since these sites keep throwing new problems and challenges out there.

This repository is mainly a personal tracking system in this state, I can see what problems I have solved on which site and in which language amd as an added bonus I'm working with GitHub while doing that. 
But if anybody has any ideas or wants to contribute in some way, feel free to contact me. 

## Moving to separate repositories

As of 30.04.2020 solutions to problems for HackerRank, Project Euler, CodeAbbey have moved to their own separate repositories.

## Important

I am providing confirmed solutions in this repository. Some of the sites which I provide solutions for will not like this.
It is not my goal at all just to provide copy-paste solutions for the too lazy, starting programmers.

Therefore I give the following advice to everyone visiting here:

> Please think about how you could the problems/challenges and try it youself.
> Do not just come here and copy-paste the solutions, keep trying and researching to solve it on your own.
> Make use of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
>
> Post the code you have up until now and let others take a look at it, maybe they can point you in the right direction.
> Only if all that still leads to no result, you can use my solutions for comparrison.
